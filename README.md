# ISARC2023_PointCloudWorkshop

## Introduction
This repository simply contains the Jupyter Notebook and data that were used for the "Processing Point Cloud" Workshop delivered at ISARC 2024 (International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction) https://isarc2023.com/r3/

This Jupyter Notebook enables you to go through many, often fundamental steps in the processing of point clouds, particularly in the context of their use in the Built Environment context, such as Scan-to-BIM and Scan-vs-BIM applications. The Jupyter Notebook is organised in 11 sections:
1. Environment Setup
2. Load Files (e.g. point clouds) to be processed
3. Visualize point cloud
4. Down-sample point cloud
5. Calculate point normals
6. Extract planes or patches
7. Classify patches
8. Extract edges
9. Save results
10. Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation using Machine Learning
11. Scan-vs-BIM (colour-coding based on point-mesh proximity)

## Repository Content:
* The Jupyter Notebook with all the code and explanations for the steps above
* The Jupyter Notebook for students. This is the same notebook as above, but some lines of code have been removed that the students had to complete themselves
* The dataset referred to in the notebook to apply the code.
